This comprehensive Cloud Native Resource Monitoring Python App on Kubernetes project takes you through the entire development and deployment process. Starting by deploying the Flask application locally, you'll learn how to run a Python app, containerize it using Docker, and create a Dockerfile for building the image. The guide walks you through pushing the Docker image to Amazon ECR using Python and Boto3, including creating an ECR repository and pushing the image.

Moving on to Kubernetes, the project demonstrates creating an Amazon EKS cluster, adding node groups, and deploying the app using Python. The provided eks.py script defines Kubernetes deployments and services, leveraging the Kubernetes Python client. You'll gain hands-on experience with deploying and managing applications in a Kubernetes environment. The README.md summarizes key steps, ensuring clarity and ease of use for anyone following the project, and includes commands for checking deployments, services, and pods. This project serves as a valuable resource for those looking to enhance their skills in cloud-native application development and monitoring.
